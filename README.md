A web application designed for use by both rail commuters and infrastructuralists.

Commuters can obtain information from a particular station e.g. encroaching trains and weather in a given area. And infrastructuralists can easily peruse a variety of data relating to trains, e.g. train lateness, train location, weather and station proximity, in order to identify potential infrastructural issues.
